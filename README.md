order-truck comparison test

# Description
A common dilemma what a trucking company faces is matching vehicles and orders. 
Which truck should carry which job in order to make the operation as cheap as possible. 
This is a very common yet very complex challenge. Your task is to solve a subset of this problem.

Given two lists, the first one contains the available trucks and the compatible job types the truck can carry. The other one contains the current jobs.

Please match the vehicles with jobs, where should consider the job type constraints during the pairing. 
The types of jobs are marked with letters. Each truck has a list of letters that indicates the compatible job types.

The goal is to find a truck for each job. If you canâ€™t find truck for all the jobs, a partial solution is also acceptable.
